    // only ever receives one value.

    // Every check here has a silent failure mode, which is why they are enforced rather than
    // documented: a point outside the box samples past its own atlas cell, a flipped triangle is
    // culled and simply missing, a degenerate one collides with nothing, an unreferenced point is
    // invisible to both paths, and an index past the end would throw deep inside a bake.
    //
    // Fix delegates to ShapeGeometryUtils.Sanitize - the same call the in-game shape editor makes on
    // Save. That sharing is the point: a shape the editor accepts must be a shape validation
    // accepts, and two implementations would eventually disagree about which.

    /// <summary>
    /// Indexed shape geometry must be well formed: whole triples, in-range indices, points inside
    /// the authored box, no degenerate or back-facing triangles, no unreferenced points.
