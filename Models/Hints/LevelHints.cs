    // The level's fifth aggregate, and the only one that carries nothing authored. Everything here
    // is DERIVED from Settings/Game/Audio/Resources, written by whoever saves the level, and safe to
    // throw away: a consumer that ignores this whole object plays the exact same level, only paying
    // at load or mid-playback for work a hint would have front-loaded. That is the membership test -
    // a field belongs here when it can be recomputed from the rest of the level and nothing looks
    // different when it is missing, wrong or stale.
    //
    // It exists as its own aggregate rather than as fields on the aggregates the hints describe
    // (Limits used to sit on LevelSettings, FontCharacters on LevelResources) because those two
    // neighbourhoods are authoritative: a reader there cannot tell "the author decided this" from
    // "a tool measured this last save". Everything advisory living behind one property makes the
    // distinction structural - and makes "recompute every hint" and "drop every hint" one call each
    // rather than a list someone has to keep current.
    //
    // Consequence for the format: a level written before this existed deserializes to an all-empty
    // Hints, which is exactly "no hint", so the move needed no migration and the Level domain stays
    // at (1, 0). A level whose hints were written by an older layout simply loses them at the next
    // save, which is what advisory means.
