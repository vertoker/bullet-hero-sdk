    // The three values are not three shaders. Opaque and Transparent name the two render paths a
    // consumer actually has; Auto names the absence of an authored choice and leaves the consumer
    // to derive one from the object's own data. A consumer that derives it must never change how a
    // level looks - an object is only Auto-Opaque when every alpha it can resolve to is 1.
