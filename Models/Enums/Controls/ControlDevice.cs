    // A gamepad is ONE device here, not three. An earlier design split its sticks, its touchpad and its
    // motion sensor into separate entries; both extra entries are gone, because the Input System exposes
    // neither a pad's touchpad position nor its gyro on any layout it ships, and reaching them meant
    // per-brand HID work for every pad family in existence. Everything gamepad-shaped goes through the
    // Input System's own Gamepad, and the phone's own sensor stays its own device (DeviceGyro), since that
    // one is genuinely readable.
