    // in the file can answer alone, only the file plus a service's policy.

    // Nothing here repairs anything, for the same reason graph findings never do: every fix is a
    // fact the author has to supply. Naming a license nobody read, or crediting an author nobody
    // identified, would be the analyzer inventing the very paperwork it exists to demand.
    //
    // The level file is optional and that is a designed capability, not a convenience. metadata.json
    // is its own serialization root so a catalogue can grade thousands of levels without opening one
    // of them, and the meta-only pass really does cover most of the policy. Exactly two findings need
    // level.json - a resource with no record at all (ResourceMetaMissing) and where a resource is
    // fetched from (ResourceUriTypeNotAllowed) - and the report says which pass it was, so a clean
    // meta-only result is never mistaken for a clean full one.
