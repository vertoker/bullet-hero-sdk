    // One file rather than one per type, unlike Models/Enums/: these are a transcription of another
    // project's format, not this project's vocabulary. They are read together, they change together
    // if that format changes, and splitting them into twenty files would suggest each is a decision
    // somebody here made.
    //
    // Numbering is the FORMAT's, never renumbered for tidiness - the gaps are real. Randomization
    // Type has no 2 (the wiki's own table skips it), so a value of 2 read from a file is genuinely
    // unknown rather than a member nobody bothered to write down.

    // Object type is the one place where the format's description and the files it writes disagree,
    // and the disagreement is invisible: the documented table starts at 4 (Hit / No Hit / Empty),
    // while a real level is mostly ot = 0. Read against the documented table alone, 0 is "not Hit",
    // so two thirds of a level's objects arrive with no collider and the level plays as scenery.
    //
    // Both numberings are therefore accepted. The older one is the legacy Project Arrhythmia set
    // (Normal / Helper / Decoration / Empty / Solid) and it agrees with the documented one on what
    // things MEAN, only not on what they are numbered - Helper and Decoration are drawn but never
    // hit, Solid is hit like Normal.
    //
    // The member names below are the SOURCE GAME's own (reflected out of its assembly), which is
    // why 3 and 6 are both empty and only 6 has "Alpha" in the name. Measured over three real
    // levels: 6 is what an empty is actually written as (445 of 446 carry no shape at all), 3 never
    // appears, 0 carries shapes and text, and 7 - a particle emitter, absent from the documented
    // table - carries a shape on 176 of its 191 objects.
