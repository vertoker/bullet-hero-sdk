    // Draw order, all of it, in one place: this is the only thing in the converter that cannot be
    // decided one object at a time, and it is resolved for a WHOLE LEVEL at once - its own objects
    // and every prefab template's - rather than per list. Per-list resolves stacked with offsets is
    // what produced the numbers this replaced: 386 placements each given a layer of their own above
    // whatever the level reached, templates ranked independently underneath them, and one real
    // level arriving spread over -520 to +401 with 894 distinct layers on 4151 objects.
    //
    // THE PLAYER LINE, measured in the source game rather than assumed. Afterbeat sorts by
    // sortingOrder in a single sorting layer: an ordinary object gets 0 (ObjectManager, the Default
    // branch), the player gets 61 (VGPlayer.Init), an AbovePlayer object gets 62 + (60 - depth),
    // and a Background object is drawn by a different camera entirely. So the whole Default band -
    // depth 0 included - is BEHIND the player, and depth orders it only by z (0.1 * depth, ordinary
    // draw distance). This format's avatar sits at layer -0.5 (Services.Shared's AvatarInitData
    // .BaseLayer), so layer >= 0 is in front of it and layer <= -1 behind: Default lands at -1 and
    // down, AbovePlayer at 0 and up, Background below Default. An earlier reading of the source put
    // the player between depth 0 and depth 1, which pulled one object per level in front of it and
    // pushed the whole rest of the level into the negatives to make room.
    //
    // THE THREE BANDS are laid out as consecutive stretches rather than interleaved, because that
    // is what the source game does: they are separate sorting ranges over there, and no depth in
    // one can reach into another.
    //
    // DEPTH IS THE ONLY ORDERING INPUT, and the source editor's own layer/bin grouping is
    // deliberately not one. It orders nothing over there - it never reaches sortingOrder - so
    // spending draw order on it reproduces an organisation the source game does not draw, at a
    // measured 6.3x the layers (221 where 35 order the level). Two objects sharing a depth share a
    // layer here, which is faithful: sharing a depth over there means sharing both sortingOrder and
    // z, i.e. an undefined order the source game does not define either, and this format already
    // separates coplanar objects deterministically (ValueRules.LayerZOffsetStep). An author who
    // wants the source editor's grouping expressed as draw order asks for it by name - that is what
