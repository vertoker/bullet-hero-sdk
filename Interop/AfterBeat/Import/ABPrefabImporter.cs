    // templates and real placements and an empty ObjectIds table, and the host is expected to
    // resync once after the import. An import used somewhere without a materializer produces a
    // level whose prefabs are present in the file and invisible on screen - which is the same thing
    // that happens to a placement created by hand, so it is a known state rather than a broken one.

    // The template gets its OWN ObjectId namespace, minted by the Prefab itself: ids are
    // scope-relative in this format, so a template object and a level object may share the number 1
