    // twenty parameters: the id table, the shape resources being synthesized on demand, the theme
    // literal colours are resolved against, and the report.
    //
    // The id table is the reason importing is TWO passes. Afterbeat identifies objects by string
    // and parents them by that string, in no particular order - a child can appear before its
    // parent. So every object is minted first and only then filled in, or half the parent links
    // resolve to nothing purely because of where they sat in the file.
    //
    // EffectiveLayers exists for the same kind of reason: Afterbeat's depth is ABSOLUTE and this
    // format's Layer is relative to the parent, so writing a child's layer needs its parent's
    // effective one, which is not stored anywhere on the model being built. It is filled by that
    // same first pass, and for the same reason - filling it as the second pass walks the list
    // answers zero for every parent that happens to be written later.
