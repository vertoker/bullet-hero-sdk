    // The same bargain the rest of External/ makes, for a different reason. The others exist
    // because the SDK has no decoder; this one exists because an Afterbeat level folder is
    // somebody ELSE'S format, probed rather than known - which names the folder differs per level
    // and is documented nowhere - so the host is what opens it and hands over what it found.
    //
    // It is NOT that the SDK cannot read a file. It used to be: Services/Content now addresses
    // directories and archives directly, and the level package pipeline built on it reads and
    // writes both. What has not changed is who decides what an Afterbeat folder CONTAINS.
    //
    // Text rather than paths, deliberately: it keeps this side free of IO, and it lets the same
    // generator run against a folder, a zip entry, or a paste from a web page without knowing which.
