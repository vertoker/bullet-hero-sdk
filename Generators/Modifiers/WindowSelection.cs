    // The asymmetry is the whole point and is NOT an oversight: Invert selects what shares no frame
    // at all with the window, its opposite selects only what lies wholly inside it. Making both
    // "overlaps" would mean content hanging over the edge is taken whichever way the flag is set,
    // which is not a mode - it is a trap.
