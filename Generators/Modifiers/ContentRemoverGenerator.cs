    // The one generator that only ever DELETES, and the only one for which the context window is an
    // instruction rather than a boundary. Everywhere else the context span says where new
    // content may be written; here it says which content is being talked about - which is what makes
    // "clean up everything the level can no longer play" (window = whole level, Invert on) and "wipe
    // this section" (window = the section, Invert off) the same operation with one flag between them.
    // A host that offers a whole-level switch on its window - the in-game editor does - gets the
    // first for free without this generator knowing anything about a level's own FrameDuration.
    //
    // Partial overlap survives BOTH modes on purpose, and the asymmetry in WindowSelection.Selects
    // is what implements it: Invert deletes what shares NO frame with the window, and its opposite
    // deletes only what lies WHOLLY inside it. Making both tests "overlaps" would mean an object
    // hanging over the edge is deleted whichever way the flag is set, which is not a mode - it is a
    // trap. mod_span_fit selects the objects it fits through the very same helper.
    //
    // Deleting is never per-object: an object being removed may still PARENT one that is staying,
    // and dropping it alone leaves a dangling ParentObjectId that LevelGraphAnalyzer then reports -
    // a cleanup pass that breaks the level it cleaned. Hence keep-marking (a surviving object marks
    // its whole ancestor chain) instead of a per-object test, plus the same for a surviving
    // PrefabObject's materialized children, which its own ObjectIds table points at.
