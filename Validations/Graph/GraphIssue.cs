    // and collection keys ending at one value - which is exactly what a graph finding is not: "these
    // two objects share an id", "this chain loops back on itself" have no single property to point
    // at, and no property to write a repair into. Forcing them into that shape would produce issues
    // whose Fix could not run and whose path lied about where the problem was.
    //
    // A finding here therefore carries no repair at all, and the type has no machinery for one: which
    // of two colliding objects keeps its id, where a broken chain reattaches, are content decisions,
    // and guessing would silently rewrite the author's level. The one relationship that did have a
    // uniquely determined repair - a child's span reaching outside its parent's - is not a finding
    // any more: the overhang is legal data resolved away on read, and fitting the lifetimes is an
    // edit the author asks for (mod_span_fit). Should a future invariant genuinely need a repair, it
    // belongs there too, as a generator, not as a fix delegate reporting itself as a defect.
