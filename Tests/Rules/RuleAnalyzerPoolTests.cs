    // never comes back is invisible until the pool runs dry - from then on every Analyze dies on an
    // empty stack instead of reporting rules, and a shared analyzer carries that damage to every
    // consumer that touches it afterwards. That is how this regressed once: the misapplied-rule throw
    // is by design (AssertWrongType provokes it in most files of this folder) and it leaked a buffer
    // per occurrence, so the whole folder started failing once past the prewarmed count - including
    // across separate test runs, since an analyzer can outlive one run in a static field.

    // on throw, and the prewarmed count is an optimization rather than a depth limit.
